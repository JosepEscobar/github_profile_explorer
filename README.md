## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows a **Clean MVVM Modular** architecture that provides a clear separation of responsibilities and facilitates maintenance and scalability:

### Layers

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Layer</b></td>
    <td><b>Responsibility</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Domain</td>
    <td>Business entities, use cases, and repository interfaces</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data</td>
    <td>Concrete implementations of repositories, networking, and mappers</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Presentation</td>
    <td>Platform-specific ViewModels and Views</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SharedUI</td>
    <td>UI components shared across platforms</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Principles

- **Modularity**: Layers separated into independent modules
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has a specific responsibility
- **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies point towards the domain
- **Framework Independence**: The domain does not depend on external frameworks

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project organization reflects the modular architecture:

### Domain Layer

The **Domain Layer** is the core of the application, platform and framework independent:

- **Models**: Define the main data structures (`User`, `Repository`, `LanguageStat`, `AppError`)
- **Use Cases**: Implement business logic (`FetchUserUseCase`, `ManageSearchHistoryUseCase`, `FilterRepositoriesUseCase`)
- **Interfaces**: Define protocols for repositories, ensuring a clean separation between logic and data access

### Data Layer

The **Data Layer** manages access to external data:

- **Repositories**: Implement data access logic (`UserRepository`)
- **API**: Contains network infrastructure (`NetworkClient`, `Endpoint`)
- **Mappers**: Convert data between different layers (`UserMapper`, `RepositoryMapper`)

### Presentation Layer

The **Presentation Layer** is divided into platform-specific sublayers:

- **iOS**: Views and ViewModels adapted for mobile devices
- **iPadOS**: Interfaces optimized for tablets with adaptive layouts
- **macOS**: Desktop experience with advanced features
- **tvOS**: Navigation adapted to remote control and large screens
- **visionOS**: Immersive experiences with 3D elements and RealityKit

### SharedUI

Contains reusable UI components and models shared across platforms:

- **Components**: Common views like `SearchBarView`, `AvatarImageView`, and `LoadingView`
- **UIModels**: Shared presentation models
- **ViewModels**: Common presentation logic

## üîç Design Patterns

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Pattern</b></td>
    <td><b>Implementation</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Repository Pattern</td>
    <td>Abstracts data access and hides API implementation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Use Case Pattern</td>
    <td>Encapsulates business logic in independent and reusable classes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MVVM</td>
    <td>Separates presentation logic (ViewModel) from visualization (View)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dependency Injection</td>
    <td>Injects dependencies instead of creating them within classes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Factory Method</td>
    <td>Creates specific instances according to the platform</td>
  </tr>
</table>
